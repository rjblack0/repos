//CODE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION

//Statistics are often calculated with varying amounts of input data. Write a program that takes any number of non-negative integers as input, and outputs the average and max. A negative integer ends the input and is not included in the statistics.
//Ex: When the input is 15 20 0 5 -1, the output is:
//10 20
//You can assume that at least one non-negative integer is input.



integer x
integer max

x = Get next input

if x > y
   max = x
elseif y > z
   max = y
else
   max = z

Put max to output

While x > 0
