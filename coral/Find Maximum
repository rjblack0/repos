//Write a program whose inputs are three integers, and whose output is the largest of the three values.
//Ex: If the input is 7 15 3, the output is:
//15

integer x
integer y
integer z
integer max

x = Get next input
y = Get next input
z = Get next input

if x > y
   max = x
elseif y > z
   max = y
else
   max = z

Put max to output
