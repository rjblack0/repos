//How do you declare a variable

var
let

let message;
message = 'Hello'; //store the string 'Hello' in the variable
alert(message); //shows the variable content

//alternative
let message2 = 'Hello!';
alert (message2);

//multiple variables
let user = 'John', age = 25, message3 = 'Hello';

//this is recommended
let user = 'Mitch'
let age = 20
let message4 = 'Hi'

//another option is
let user = 'Jason'
    , age = 30
    , message5 = 'Yes'

//Variables can be interchanged
let hello = 'Hello World!'
let message
    let message = hello

alert(hello)
alert(message)

//adding together

let $ = 1
let _ = 2

alert($ + _) // 3

const
//Constants cannot be reassigned
const myBirthday = '20.12.1985';

//Use ALL CAPS for alias' of difficult to remember / values
const COLOR_RED = "#F00"

//Practice
let admin;
let name;

let name = 'John';
let admin = name;
alert(admin)
