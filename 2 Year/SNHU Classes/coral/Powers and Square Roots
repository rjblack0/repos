//Given three floating-point numbers x, y, and z, output x to the power of y, x to the power of (y to the power of z), the absolute value of x, and the square root of (xy to the power of z).
//Ex: If the input is 5.0 6.5 3.2, the output is:
//34938.56214843421 1.2995143401732918e+279 5.0 262.42993783925596
